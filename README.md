Continuous Integration and Deployment of Flask App using AWS CodePipeline
This project demonstrates the utilization of AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment of a Flask application.

Files Included:
buildspec.yml: Contains build configuration.
appspec.yml: Contains deployment configuration.
test: Test file located in the home directory for monitoring and alerts.
scripts:
before_install: Script that executes before the package is installed. Useful for preparatory tasks or checks before installation.
after_install: Script executed after a successful package installation. Often used for additional setup or configuration tasks.
app_start: Script to start the application. Triggered after installation or when launching the application.
validate_service: Script focused on validating or checking the status of the service after deployment.
Deployment Flow:
Build Phase (CodePipeline):

AWS CodePipeline is configured to initiate the build process according to the specifications defined in buildspec.yml.
Deployment Configuration (AppSpec):

appspec.yml defines the deployment configuration necessary for deploying the Flask application.
Nginx for Proxy and Redirection:

Nginx is utilized to redirect proxy for the Flask app, ensuring proper handling of incoming requests.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Monitoring and alerts are set up using AWS CloudWatch and AWS SNS for tracking and receiving notifications about events and performance.
Lifecycle Scripts Overview:
before_install:
This script executes preparatory tasks or checks before the package installation process begins.

after_install:
Executes additional setup or configuration tasks following a successful package installation.

app_start:
Initiates the application, typically triggered after installation or when launching the application.

validate_service:
Validates or checks the status of the deployed service to ensure it's running properly.
